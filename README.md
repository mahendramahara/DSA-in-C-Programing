## Introduction

Understanding data structures and algorithms is fundamental to becoming a proficient programmer. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of C implementations for various data structures and algorithms. Whether you're a student, a software engineer, or an enthusiast, you'll find valuable resources here to deepen your understanding and improve your coding skills.

## Data Structures

### Linked Lists

Linked lists are linear data structures where elements are linked using pointers. They come in various forms, such as singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists. In this repository, you'll find implementations of these linked list variants along with operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

### Stacks

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. It supports two main operations: push (to add an element) and pop (to remove the top element). Implementations of stack data structure with various functionalities are available here.

### Queues

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. It supports operations like enqueue (to add an element) and dequeue (to remove the front element). This repository contains implementations of queue data structures and their associated operations.

### Trees

Trees are hierarchical data structures consisting of nodes connected by edges. Common types of trees include binary trees, binary search trees (BSTs), AVL trees, and B-trees. You'll find implementations of these tree variants and their operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

### Graphs

Graphs are non-linear data structures consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting these nodes. They are widely used to model relationships between objects. This repository includes implementations of various graph algorithms like breadth-first search (BFS), depth-first search (DFS), Dijkstra's algorithm, and more.

## Algorithms

### Searching

Searching algorithms are used to find a particular element in a data structure. Common searching algorithms include linear search, binary search, and interpolation search. You'll find C implementations of these algorithms along with their explanations and complexities.

### Sorting

Sorting algorithms are used to arrange elements in a specific order, such as ascending or descending. Common sorting algorithms include bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort, and heap sort. This repository provides C implementations of these sorting algorithms and their comparisons.

### Recursion

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of a problem. It is commonly used in algorithms like factorial calculation, Fibonacci sequence generation, and binary tree traversal. You'll find recursive implementations of various algorithms in this repository.

### Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and solving each subproblem only once. It is used to optimize algorithms by storing the results of subproblems to avoid redundant computations. This repository includes dynamic programming solutions to classic problems like the knapsack problem, longest common subsequence, and more.

### Greedy Algorithms

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. They are often used for optimization problems where a sequence of choices must be made. This repository contains C implementations of greedy algorithms like Kruskal's algorithm, Prim's algorithm, and Dijkstra's algorithm.

### Graph Algorithms

Graph algorithms are used to solve problems related to graphs, such as finding the shortest path, detecting cycles, and determining connectivity. This repository provides C implementations of fundamental graph algorithms like BFS, DFS, topological sorting, and more.
